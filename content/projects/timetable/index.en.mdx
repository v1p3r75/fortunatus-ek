- Email: admin@test.com
- password: admin

## How to install Django

Open your terminal and run the following command to install Django using the pip package management tool:
```bash
pip install Django
```
If you are using a specific version of Python, use the following command to install Django instead:

```bash
python -m pip install Django
```
Wait for the installation to complete. Once it is complete, you should have Django installed on your machine.

To check if Django is installed correctly, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
django-admin --version
```
This will display the version of Django installed.

Now that you have Django installed, you can continue working on the IFRI 2022 integration project.

## How to launch the application on your machine

To retrieve and launch the application on your machine, first make sure you have python and django installed on your machine. Then proceed to the following steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/v1p3r75/timetable

cd timetable

python manage.py migrate

python manage.py runserver 8000
```
The application will start on the address http://localhost:8000 : copy this address and launch it in the browser.

The application is now launched!

## How to work on the project

To work on the project, follow the steps below:

Make sure you get the necessary authorization to work on the project.

- Clone the repository to your machine if you haven't already.

- Before you start working on a new feature, make sure to create a separate branch for it.

- Use the following command to create a new branch from the main branch

```bash
git checkout -b your_branch_name
```

- Work on your branch by making the necessary changes.

- Once you are done with the changes, add the changed files to the Git tracker using the command: git add .

- Commit your changes by creating a descriptive commit:
```bash
git commit -m "Commit description"
```

- Push your branch to the remote repository using the command:
```bash
git push origin your_branch_name
```

- Once you are satisfied with your changes and want to integrate them into the main project, create a pull request on the project management platform.

- Wait for the code review and comments from other team members.

- Make the necessary adjustments based on the comments received and continue pushing your changes to your branch.

- Once your merge request has been approved, your branch can be merged into the main branch of the project.

## Mistake to avoid

In order to maintain an efficient workflow and ensure code quality, here are some mistakes to avoid when contributing to the project:

- Don't work directly on the main branch of the project.

- Use separate branches for each feature.

- Don't forget to create coherent and descriptive commits for each change.

- Don't forget to test your changes before pushing them to the remote repository.

- Don't merge your own branch without going through a code review by other team members.

- Take into account the team's comments and suggestions during the code review and make the necessary adjustments.

- By following these best practices, we can maintain an efficient workflow and ensure the quality of the code produced.
